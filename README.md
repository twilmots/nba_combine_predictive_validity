# Does the NBA Draft Combine have any predictive power?

The National Basketball Assocation (NBA) has been holding a player draft every year since 1947. The draft is responsible for the influx of 60 players into the league each year. Teams and the media spend a lot of money and energy around this event as they try to get a strategic edge over their competitors and make the best predictions and select the best players available.

Every year, analysts and teams try to rank the available players based on various datasets and past performance. Major sports networks put a lot of effort into predicting the success of players and providing a great detail of in-depth analysis of each player for their customers to consume. One key aspect of this analyis centers around their biometric data. In order to collect this data, the NBA holds an annual NBA Combine where the players are put through a series of physical tests aimed to quantify their stature and athletic ability. This data is then made publicly available to teams and the media.

The aim of this project is to quantify the predictive validity of the publicly available biometric data, and discern if the intense focus given to this data is necessary and justifiable. My hypothesis is that, in isolation, it will not be a good prediction for succes. 

This project was completed as part of my Immersive Data Science course taken through General Assembly.
